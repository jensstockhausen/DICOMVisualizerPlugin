# DICOMVisualizerPlugin

Displays the content of DICOM files as a table.<br>

Use the right mouse menue on DICOM files that are part of your project.
The plugin works with all DICOM files even if they don't have the .dcm extension.

A search field is available.

By default binary bulk data (e.g. pixel data) is not loaded and displayed. This can be enabled with a checkbox.
